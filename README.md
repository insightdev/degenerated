##Installation
[Download zip](https://github.com/insightdev/degenerated/releases/latest) and drag to your desktop.

##Usage
1. Open Terminal.
2. Type `cd`, press space, and then drag in the folder containing this document. Press enter.
3. Type `ruby white.rb`
4. Type in the path to your Java file (no whitespace at the end!) -- the path is the location to your file, for example `/Users/user/Desktop/TicTacToe.java`. You can also drag your java file into the Terminal window and then press delete once to delete the space at the end.

A new file is created in the same directory as your java file, with an '_edit' appended, containing the changes.
